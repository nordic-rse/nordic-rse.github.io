    <h1 id="code-of-conduct-for-in-person-conferences">Code of conduct for In Person Conferences</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>This code of conduct is copied and adapted from the example policy at the
<a href="https://geekfeminism.fandom.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy">Geek Feminism wiki</a>,
created by the Ada Initiative and other volunteers (CC-0 license).
The procedure for reporting harassment has been adapted from the Ada Initiative's guide titled
<a href="http://geekfeminism.fandom.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Responding_to_reports">&quot;workshop anti-harassment/Responding to Reports&quot;</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We value the participation of each stakeholder and want our members and
participants to our events to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience.
Accordingly, all members and participants are expected to show respect and
courtesy to other members and participants through all communication channels.</p>
<p>To make clear what is expected, all Nordic-RSE members as well as participants,
speakers, exhibitors, organisers and volunteers at Nordic-RSE events are
required to conform to the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce
this code throughout the event.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do
not tolerate harassment in any form.</p>
<p>All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including
people of many different backgrounds.</p>
<p>Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down others.</p>
<p>Behave professionally. Remember that harassment, unprofessional remarks and
messages, and exclusionary jokes are not appropriate in Nordic-RSE.</p>
<p>Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from
the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.
Members of Nordic-RSE may have their membership revoked by the board.</p>
<p>Thank you for making the Nordic-RSE conference a welcoming and friendly event
for all.</p>
<h3 id="clarifications">Clarifications</h3>
<p>Harassment includes offensive communication related to gender, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual
images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following,
harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other
events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply
immediately.</p>
<p>Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that words can be offensive
to those around you. Offensive jokes are not acceptable in the Nordic-RSE.
Excessive swearing is not appropriate.</p>
<h3 id="enforcement">Enforcement</h3>
<p>If a participant at a Nordic-RSE event violates this code of conduct,
organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including a
warning the offender, removing them from the workshop with no refund, or 
banning the offender from future Nordic-RSE events.</p>
<p>If a member of Nordic RSE engages in behaviour that violates this code of conduct,
the board of the association at the recommendation of the Code of Conduct committee
may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or revoking
their membership without refund of the membership fee.</p>
<h3 id="reporting">Reporting</h3>
<p>If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it
as soon as possible. Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the
value of our event for everyone. We want you to be happy at our event. People
like you make our event a better place.</p>
<p>You can make a report by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contacting any member of the Code of Conduct committee
<ul>
<li>Heli Juottonen (heli.juottonen [at] csc.fi)</li>
<li>Julia Beck (julia.beck [at] lir.gu.se)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Contacting any conference organizer</li>
<li>Contacting any member of the <a href="/about/governance/">Nordic-RSE board</a></li>
</ul>
<p>When taking a report, organizers will ensure you are safe and cannot be
overheard. They may involve other event staff to ensure your report is managed properly.
Once safe, we'll ask you to tell us about what happened. This can be upsetting, but
we'll handle it as respectfully as possible, and you can bring someone to support you.
You won't be asked to confront anyone and we won't tell anyone who you are.</p>
<p>Our team will be happy to help you contact hotel/venue security, local law enforcement,
local support services, provide escorts, or otherwise assist you to feel safe for the
duration of the event. We value your attendance.</p>
