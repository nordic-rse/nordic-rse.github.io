    <h1>Nordic-RSE friendship book</h1>

    Samantha Wittke
    <br>
    November 17, 2025

    <div>
      <p>At the Nordic-RSE conference 2025 we asked participants to fill out a Nordic-RSE friendship book page. 
About 20 people submitted their page to create this overview of the community, 
including their wishes and greatest achievements. This is a summary of what they wrote:</p>
<h3 id="a-variety-of-job-titles-preferred-languages-and-career-stages">A variety of job titles, preferred languages and career stages</h3>
<p><strong>RSE enthusiasts</strong> may &quot;hide&quot; behind any of the following <strong>job titles</strong>: </p>
<ul>
<li>(Digital) Research (Software) Engineer</li>
<li>System administrator</li>
<li>Data Engineer / Scientist</li>
<li>HPC Engineer</li>
<li>Researcher</li>
<li>XX Specialist / Expert.</li>
</ul>
<p>They often <strong>like to code</strong> in Python, but you may also find them using R, C, Julia, HTML/JavaScript, JS, Rust, STAN, Mojo, Bash, Groovy, Haskell,
Fortran, C++, and OCaml or &quot;whatever gets the job done&quot;. </p>
<p>Here are some highlights of peoples <strong>git commit message of their current career stage</strong>: </p>
<ul>
<li>linting (no changes)</li>
<li>detached career HEAD state</li>
<li>taking a break soon – working on two ‘branches’ created with another developer.</li>
<li>small update waiting for big PR</li>
<li>&quot;Eierlegende Wollmilchsau&quot; (the legendary egg-laying wool-milk pig)</li>
<li>WIP</li>
<li>stable now, will have to be revised</li>
<li>empty message, commit aborted</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="codes-written-to-power-research-vs-simplifying-everyday-tasks">Codes written to power research vs simplifying everyday tasks</h3>
<p>People described a wide range of <strong>“most useful” code</strong> they’ve written, spanning both highly technical tools and small personal utilities. 
These include scripts for analysing behavioural data, generating scientific colormaps, visualising audio signals, calculating twilight times, 
and supporting DNA nanotechnology platforms. Others built practical automation—aliases for common commands, data-transformation pipelines, 
hyperparameter search routines, and plotting tools for complex statistical outputs. Some created large-scale research software, such as pharmacokinetic simulators, 
protein-modelling toolkits, molecular-dynamics workflows, and systems for running PyTorch on supercomputers. A few mentioned niche or personal favourites, 
from RPN calculators and regulatory-genesis analysis tools to code that plays YouTube channels or helps explore electrons and atoms — 
all illustrating how <em>useful</em> can mean anything from powering major research to simplifying everyday tasks.</p>
<h3 id="rse-olympics-would-be-fun">RSE Olympics would be fun!</h3>
<p>The <strong>“RSE Olympics”</strong> span a wonderfully chaotic mix of technical prowess and creative problem-solving: from assembly-level speed contests and mastering system architecture, 
deployment, HPC, SLURM, and AI workflows, to niche events like Python packaging, installing stubborn R packages, and “ansiblifying all the things.” 
Competitors show off MacGyver-style hacks using libraries never meant for their purpose, tackle research data management and data-standardisation marathons, 
and craft web-based research tools. Judging panels evaluate feats of linting, unit-test-adding, and code-review-starting, while side events include ranting about 
overpriced spaghetti-code software and fencing with rogue computing parts. The suggested disciplines celebrate the full spectrum of RSE ingenuity.</p>
<h3 id="give-resources-to-rses-and-you-will-get">Give resources to RSEs and you will get...</h3>
<p>With <strong>infinite resources</strong>, people would pour them into ambitious scientific infrastructure, transformative education, and cleaner, more sustainable research software. 
Their dreams range from advancing lattice field theory, quantum codes, molecular modelling, drug-design tools, and massive ML-HPC training systems to building a 
better operating system for science itself. 
Many would fund universal training: Intro to Git and Python/R courses at every university, comprehensive learning materials, and dedicated programs to teach 
researchers reproducible workflows. 
Others imagine perfect research data and metadata management, refactoring critical scientific software, or creating world-class environments such as a fully 
supported supercomputer-ready R ecosystem. Some would invest in visualisation frameworks, sustainability in programming, genealogy knowledge systems, 
or even verified safe AI. And of course, with limitless resources, there’d still be room for joyful explorations like large wisdom productions and microbenchmarking.</p>
<h3 id="training-needs-and-community-wishes">Training needs and community wishes</h3>
<p>People expressed a <strong>need for training</strong> that strengthens both their technical depth and their ability to work effectively across diverse research and software-engineering environments. 
High on the list were practical skills—containers on HPC, SLURM, orchestration, IT security, managing Pis, and functional programming—along with language-bridging 
courses such as R for Python users and Python for non-Python users. Many want deeper computer-science foundations, including software design, design patterns, 
and understanding which core CS concepts matter in RSE work. Others highlighted training in workflow sustainability, ricing, HTML presentations, and handling AI 
responsibly in coding and teaching. There’s also demand for domain-specific expertise (like language technology), support for acquiring real depth in existing skills, 
and even meta-skills such as TTT (train-the-trainer) and guidance on how to turn RSE work into a stable full-time career.</p>
<p>People <strong>hope that Nordic-RSE will offer</strong> a blend of community support, practical resources, and structural recognition for RSE work. Wishes include seminar series, 
explainers of day-to-day tasks, and more technical training tailored specifically to RSEs, alongside non-academic skills development and accessible slides from events. 
Many want better funding—both long-term and for attending conferences—as well as SIGs, code-review groups, and institutional pressure to take software quality seriously. 
Others imagine lighter touches: improved coffee-break timings (or afternoon alternatives), cookies, a “punscherulle,” and social events like future meetups. 
Finally, members would welcome shared infrastructure such as cloud programming services, all aimed at strengthening the RSE community and making their work more visible and supported.</p>
<h3 id="why-join-nordic-rse">Why join Nordic-RSE?</h3>
<p>Based on participants answers on the question <strong>what Nordic-RSE is to them</strong>, Nordic-RSE is a welcoming, community-driven initiative that brings together like-minded 
people interested in research software engineering. It provides a great forum to share experiences, foster collaborations, discuss technical details, and gain inspiration. 
Members value it as an exciting, inclusive, and growing community that supports knowledge exchange, networking, and professional development, often highlighted by its annual conference.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you to everyone who participated, it was fun creating the pages and reading your answers! Maybe next year we will do this again and use it during the conference.</strong></p>
