# Zola build workflow.

# Prerequisites:
# - zola writes output to public/
# - variables below set correctly
#
# Setting it up:
#   It is a general limitation of gh-actions that they cannot make the very first
#   deploy to gh-pages.  It will seem to work, but not appear on the CDN to be
#   online.  You need to go to settings and set the gh-pages branch, then future
#   deploys will work.  See
#   https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-pages-action#%EF%B8%8F-first-deployment-with-github_token
