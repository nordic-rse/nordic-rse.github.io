# Privacy notice

This contains privacy notices for various aspects of the (unregistered
as of 2020) Nordic RSE association.


## Website

 * We do not track users on the website. The website is hosted by
   GitHub Pages, which [may or may not keep records of visits: see
   their privacy
   information](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement).
 * We do not use any cookies on the website.


## Membership

Nordic RSE keeps a record of its members.

* Membership data may be used for any Nordic RSE to member contact
  purposes related to the Nordic RSE chartered purpose, but will not
  be passed to others (besides other members, see below) without
  separate agreement.
* The information processed is the information requested when
  submitting a membership application, in particular name,
  affiliation, contact information, municipality of residence
  (required by Finnish Associations Act) and other professional
  information you may wish to provide.
* Membership information is stored in Google Docs.
* The Finnish Associations Act requires that names and places of residence
  of members are public to all members.
  Since membership is broad and in practice
  anyone may join, this information should be considered
  *public*.
* Membership data is explicitly collected upon becoming a member and
  may be occasionally updated.
* Your information is actively stored for as long as you are a member.
* Legal basis of processing information is performance of a contract.
  The contract is a membership agreement and may be ended at any time.
  Should you not wish to enter into a membership agreement, you will
  not become a member.

## Map

* The [Nordic RSE map](https://nordic-rse.org/map/) is considered a
  publication and all data is open, and thus not subject to privacy
  protection.  Information is voluntarily submitted by the person it
  describes.


## Events

### Event attendees

* Your registration information will be used to organize the event in
  which you have registered and provide you with information related
  to the Nordic RSE chartered purpose, for the duration and shortly
  after the event.
* The information processed is the information requested when
  registering, for example including name, job title, affiliation,
  registration preferences (sessions to attend, etc), and other
  information related to hosting the event.
* Your information is stored for at most one year after the end of the
  event.
* Registration information is not saved indefinitely and does not
  imply membership in Nordic RSE.
* Demographic data may be saved and publicly reported in aggregate.
* Registration data is not shared with other participants unless you
  specifically request, but note that online platforms may expose
  your name.
* The legal basis of processing this information is performance of a
  contract.  The contract is a registration agreement and may be ended
  at any time.  Should you not wish to enter into a registration
  agreement, you will not be registered.


### Presenters and authors

* By submitting a request to present at an event event, your
  information is processed for the purposes of organizing the event.
* The information processed is the information provided at submission
  time, for example, title, abstract, any material you provide, and
  information about the presenter (name, affiliation, possible contact
  information - depending on what is provided).
* Once an event is accepted, the information related to your event
  is published and no longer subject to privacy protection.  This
  (and exact information which will be published) is explicitly
  confirmed before publication, though.
* The legal basis of processing this information is performance of a
  contract.  The contract is a request to present at an event and may
  be ended at any time prior to publication of data.  Should you not
  wish to enter into a agreement to present, you will not be
  considered for presentation.


## General information

* Information will be processed privately using free services such as
  Google Drive, Indico, and Github.
