# Get involved

## Yourself

We have multiple ways to become involved with Nordic-RSE:

### Chat with us

* Join the [CodeRefinery Zulip chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com), there are a lot of very interesting discussions going on here! You can introduce yourself in the #new-members stream. Nordic-RSE related discussion can be followed in the #nordic-rse stream.
* Come say hi to our [weekly coffeebreak](/events/coffeebreak/), where we chat and have fun

### Stay Tuned
* Become a member [here](/about/membership/) and follow our [calendar](/events/#calendar)
* Visit our community biweekly [meetings](/events/meeting/#community-discussions-biweekly), where we plan activities and stuff

### Share your skills

* Have you developed a tool you'd like to share? A skill you would like to teach others? Something you find useful and interesting? Then you may want to give a talk to our [semianr series](/events/seminar-series/). You can propose a talk [here](https://github.com/nordic-rse/nordic-rse.github.io/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Seminar&template=seminar-series-event.md&title=Seminar+event+idea).

## As Company / Institute / University

We are currently thinking about how we can best provide and receive help from companies, institutes and universities and will update this page as soon as we can.

If you have ideas on how we could help each other, let us know!
See [contact page](/about/governance/contact/).
