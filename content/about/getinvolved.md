# Get involved

## Yourself

We have multiple ways to get involved with Nordic-RSE:

### Chat with us

* Join the [CodeRefinery Zulip chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com), there are a lot of very interesting discussions going on here! You can introduce yourself in the #greetings stream. Nordic-RSE related discussion can be followed in the #nordic-rse stream.
* Come say hi to our [weekly coffee break](@/events/meetings.md), where we chat and have fun.

### Stay Tuned

* Become a member [here](/about/membership/) and follow our [calendar](/events/#calendar)
* Visit our community biweekly [meetings](/events/meeting/#community-discussions-biweekly), where we plan activities, such as our annual conference

## As Company / Institute / University

We are currently thinking about how we can best provide and receive help from companies, institutes and universities and will update this page as soon as we can.

If you have ideas on how we could help each other, let us know!
See [contact page](/about/governance/contact/).
