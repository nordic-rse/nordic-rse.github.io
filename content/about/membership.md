# Becoming a member

### Why become a member

 - We aspire to represent and support all research software engineers in the
   Nordics and Baltics. When we represent you and form collaborations, our word
   has more weight when we have more members.

   For example, we work to get software journals and software publications the
   acknowledgment they deserve as contributions to science. Having more members
   means we represent a larger percentage of academic researchers. We can also
   draw on our members experiences to support our case.

 - We run events that are useful to our members, such as seminars, workshops
   and an annual unconference. Your membership fee helps make these events
   possible.

   In-person events may have a participation fee and members get discounts.

 - An association is owned by its members. As a member you can participate in
   the associations annual meeting and vote on the direction the association
   is evolving.
