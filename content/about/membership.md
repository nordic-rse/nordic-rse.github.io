# Becoming a member

## Why become a member

 - We aspire to represent and support all research software engineers in the
   Nordics and Baltics. When we represent you and form collaborations, our word
   has more weight when we have more members.

   For example, we work to get software journals and software publications the
   acknowledgment they deserve as contributions to science. Having more members
   means we represent a larger percentage of people who care. We can also
   draw on our members experiences to support our case.

 - We run events that are useful to our members, such as seminars, workshops
   and an annual unconference. Your membership fee helps make these events
   possible.

   In-person events may have a participation fee and members get discounts in the future.

 - An association is owned by its members. As a member, you can vote in the
   association annual meeting.


## How it works:

To become a member you need to
 - register by filling out the [membership form](https://forms.gle/bgvYgFHrVMFrccHt6) and
 - pay the membership fee. See the [instructions](/about/membership-fee).
   - if you want to be a member but cannot afford the fee, send an email to secretary@nordic-rse.org to ask for a concessionary membership. Each request will be evaluated by the board individually.

**Duration**:
 - Your membership expires after each annual meeting. To be exact,
   the membership expires at the end of each year.
