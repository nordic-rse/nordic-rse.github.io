We value the participation of each stakeholder and want our members and
participants to our events to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience.
Accordingly, all members and participants are expected to show respect and
courtesy to other members and participants through all communication channels.

To make clear what is expected, all Nordic-RSE members as well as participants,
speakers, exhibitors, organisers and volunteers at Nordic-RSE events are
required to conform to the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce
this code throughout the event.


### Summary

We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do
not tolerate harassment in any form.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including
people of many different backgrounds.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down others.

Behave professionally. Remember that harassment, unprofessional remarks and
messages, and exclusionary jokes are not appropriate in Nordic-RSE.

Members violating these rules may have their membership revoked by the board.
Participants to events violating these rules may be asked to leave without a
refund at the sole discretion of the conference organisers.

Thank you for making Nordic-RSE a  welcoming and friendly environment for all.


### Clarifications

Harassment includes offensive communication related to gender, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual
images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following,
harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other
events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply
immediately.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that words can be offensive
to those around you. Offensive jokes are not acceptable in the Nordic-RSE.
Excessive swearing is not appropriate.

If a member engages in behaviour that violates this code of conduct, the board
of the association may take any action they deem appropriate, including
warning the offender or may revoking their membership without refund of the
membership fee.

If the offender is a member of the board, they will be excluded from any board
meetings discussing their conduct. In addition to the above, the offender may
be removed from the board.

If a participant at a Nordic-RSE event violates this code of conduct,
organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including
warning the offender or expulsion from the workshop with no refund.


### Procedure for reporting harassment

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have
any other concerns, please contact any
[member of the board](/about/governance/#board).


Events may have a separate code of conduct committee listed of the event page.
It is always appropriate to contact any member of either code of conduct
committee.

Report the harassment incident via email to a member of the code of conduct
committee. All reports are confidential.

When reporting the event to a code of conduct committee member, try to gather
as much information as available, but do not interview people about the
incident. The committee member will assist you in writing the report/collecting
information.

The important information we need consists of:
- Identifying information (name) of the participant doing the harassing
- The behaviour that was in violation
- The approximate time of the behaviour (if different than the time the report was made)
- The circumstances surrounding the incident
- Other people involved in the incident

The code of conduct committee is well informed on how to deal with the incident
and how to further proceed with the situation.  All of our committee members
are informed of the code of conduct policy and guide for handling harassment at
the workshop. There will be a mandatory code of conduct committee meeting just
prior to the event when this will be reiterated as well.
