### What is Nordic-RSE

The **Nordic Research Software Engineers** association (in short, Nordic-RSE) 
is a grass-root association that aims at providing a professional network to 
**Research Software Engineers** (RSE) in the Nordics. While the term "RSE" is 
not as of yet of common use here, Nordic-RSE is currently a community for 
people who operate at the interface between research and digital technologies 
(software, computing, data). We operate on an inclusivity base: if you think 
that the above description is you, then you are welcome in our association!

As an association, Nordic-RSE works on promoting the careers of RSE by:

* being a networking platform for specialized research supporters,
* provide a community and professional development network for RSEs
  (**in particular supporting career development**),
* organizing events to bring RSEs and related people together, and
* supporting those who want to bring RSE services and skills to their
  community (in other words, provide a RSE service).

We are a young organization and there is plenty of room to get
involved with your own ideas - please [get in
touch](/join/).

Many of us are active in **[CodeRefinery](https://coderefinery.org)**,
which focuses on teaching RSE-like skills to researchers.


### Sponsors

Nordic-RSE is supported by the [Industrial Ecology Digital Lab](https://iedl.no) and the [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk).
