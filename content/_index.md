### Who we are

This is the website of the (unregistered) **Nordic Research Software
Engineers** association.  We do or want to do the following:

* We currently informally meet, talk, and plan events.
* Provide a community and professional development network for RSEs.
* Organize Nordic-RSE conference every two years
* Periodic community chats
* Assistance in starting RSE groups

Check out what we are currently planning on the [timeline page](/other/timeline).
We are still just beginning - if you have ideas for activities we
should organize, get in touch.

We are related to (but different from) the following other groups, and
share a chat platform with them:

* **[CodeRefinery](https://coderefinery.org)** is about teaching.
  Nordic-RSE has grown out of people involved in CodeRefinery, but
  CodeRefinery is not a major project of Nordic-RSE.

* **[Nordic HPC](https://nordichpc.github.io)** was an attempt to
  bring together people from computing facilities in the Nordics (not
  just HPC).  It is not very active now, and also a separate
  activity.
