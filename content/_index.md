### Who we are

A **Research Software Engineer (RSE)** is someone in between research
and technology (software, computing, data).  Perhaps they work as a
expert within a research group, or perhaps they work as a specialist
in a service that supports other researchers.  Does this sound like
you?  Read on...

The **Nordic Research Software Engineers** association hopes to
promote the careers of RSEs and the advancement of science by:

* being a networking platform for specialized research supporters,
* provide a community and professional development network for RSEs
  (**in particular supporting career development**),
* organizing events to bring RSEs and related people together, and
* support whose who want to bring RSE services and skills to their
  community (in other words, provide a RSE service).

We are a young organization and there is plenty of room to get
involved with your own ideas - please [get in
touch](about/getinvolved).

Many of us are active in **[CodeRefinery](https://coderefinery.org)**,
which focuses on teaching RSE-like skills to researchers.

* **[Nordic HPC](https://nordichpc.github.io)** was an attempt to
  bring together people from computing facilities in the Nordics (not
  just HPC).  It is not very active now, and also a separate
  activity.
