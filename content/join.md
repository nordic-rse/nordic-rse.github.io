# Nordic research software engineers

A **research software engineer** is someone involved in research, but
more focused on the computational skills than publications.
**Nordic-RSE** is the network of these people in the Nordics and Baltics.  We
currently focus on building a network of RSEs and highlighting their
importance in the academic system.  For RSEs or people who might want to be one,
we offer opportunities for professional development and career
advancement.

We are modeled on similar international networks in the
[UK](https://rse.ac.uk), [Germany](https://de-rse.org),
[Netherlands](https://nl-rse.org/), [United
States](https://us-rse.org), and other countries.
