### Discover our events

The Nordic-RSE association organizes events to bring the community together, share knowledge, and inspire collaboration.

- **Conference**: Our main community gathering, featuring talks, discussions, and networking opportunities around research software engineering.
- **Seminars**: Previously held regularly to highlight projects and ideas – currently on hold, and we’re looking for new organizers to help bring them back.

Whether you're attending or helping to organize, our events are a great way to connect and contribute.


### Drop by for a coffee chat

Our weekly virtual coffee break is an informal space to meet others interested in research software engineering.

Everyone is welcome – no registration needed, just come and say hei/hej/moi/hæ/halló/tere/čau/labas/hi!

We chat about a mix of topics, mostly RSE-related, and it’s a great way to connect, share experiences, or simply listen in.

- **When**: Thursdays at 9:00 Europe/Stockholm (10:00 Europe/Helsinki)
([convert to your time zone](https://arewemeetingyet.com/Helsinki/2021-09-02/10:00/w))

## Support and shape the community

### Become a member of Nordic-RSE association

% Give money -> What is purpose, used for
% support by being an additional number
% get voting rights 
% invite to general assembly

- [membership form](https://forms.gle/qCVVRGXPi3Hq7inW6)
- [pay the membership fee](@/about/membership-fee.md)



#### Why become a member

 - We aspire to represent and support all research software engineers in the
   Nordics and Baltics. When we represent you and form collaborations, our word
   has more weight when we have more members.

   For example, we work to get software journals and software publications the
   acknowledgment they deserve as contributions to science. Having more members
   means we represent a larger percentage of people who care. We can also
   draw on our members experiences to support our case.

 - Have a say in what we do. We aim to run events that are useful to our members, such as seminars, workshops
   and an annual (un)conference. Your membership fee helps make these events
   possible.

 - An association is owned by its members. As a member, you can vote in the
   association annual meeting.


#### How it works:

Fill the [membership form](https://forms.gle/bgvYgFHrVMFrccHt6) and pay the membership fee to become member for one year. See the [instructions](/about/membership-fee).

### Biweekly community zoom / Collaborate and coordinate

% Purpose
% Involved in organization of events and stuff
% Reports from events

## Community discussions (every second week)

- **13:00 Europe/Stockholm (14:00 Europe/Helsinki) every second Thursday (starting 2025-08-21)**
  ([convert to your time zone](https://arewemeetingyet.com/Helsinki/2021-09-02/14:00/w)).
- [Zoom link](https://aalto.zoom.us/j/62426845282) (Zoom ID 624 2684 5282).
- [Notes](https://hackmd.io/@nordic-rse/biweekly)

% During our biweekly community meeting we discuss what we, as Nordic-RSE can do
to get RSE and RSE-minded people together to discuss the topics that interest
us.  RSE in the Nordics is not well known (yet), so a big part of discussions
are also around how we can make it more known. There is no requirement to join
the meetings, other than an interest in what we are doing.  Anyone is very
welcome to provide some of their time to advance these goals, be it minutes or
days. 

### Board / Help lead the community

The Nordic-RSE asssociation is represented through the board. The board handles necessary
official actions, paperwork and budgeting. 

The board of the association meets when required (roughly twice a year). 

## Association meeting (yearly)

%Once every year all members of the Nordic-RSE association are invited to the
annual meeting. The annual meeting chooses the board and other officials, and
decides the annual membership fee. The annual meeting may also decide other
matters, but these will be introduced in the invitation.
