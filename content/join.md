### Discover our events

The Nordic-RSE association organizes events to bring the community together, share knowledge, and inspire collaboration.

- **Conference**: Our main community gathering, featuring talks, discussions, and networking opportunities around research software engineering.
- **Seminars**: Previously held regularly to highlight projects and ideas – currently on hold, and we’re looking for new organizers to help bring them back.

Whether you're attending or helping to organize, our events are a great way to connect and contribute.


### Drop by for a coffee chat

Our weekly virtual coffee break is an informal space to meet others interested in research software engineering.

Everyone is welcome – no registration needed, just come and say hei/hej/moi/hæ/halló/tere/čau/labas/hi!

We chat about a mix of topics, mostly RSE-related, and it’s a great way to connect, share experiences, or simply listen in.

([convert to your time zone](https://arewemeetingyet.com/Helsinki/2021-09-02/10:00/w))

## Support and shape the community

### Become a member of Nordic-RSE association

Joining the Nordic-RSE association is a way to support and strengthen the research software engineering community across the Nordic region.
Your membership helps:

- Fund community activities and events through a modest annual fee
- Increase our visibility and impact by growing our member base
- Give you voting rights on important decisions
- Invite you to participate in the general assembly

% Give money -> What is purpose, used for

- [membership form](https://forms.gle/qCVVRGXPi3Hq7inW6)
- [pay the membership fee](@/about/membership-fee.md)



#### Why become a member

 - We aspire to represent and support all research software engineers in the
   Nordics and Baltics. When we represent you and form collaborations, our word
   has more weight when we have more members.

   For example, we work to get software journals and software publications the
   acknowledgment they deserve as contributions to science. Having more members
   means we represent a larger percentage of people who care. We can also
   draw on our members experiences to support our case.

 - Have a say in what we do. We aim to run events that are useful to our members, such as seminars, workshops
   and an annual (un)conference. Your membership fee helps make these events
   possible.

 - An association is owned by its members. As a member, you can vote in the
   association annual meeting.


#### How it works:

Fill the [membership form](https://forms.gle/bgvYgFHrVMFrccHt6) and pay the membership fee to become member for one year. See the [instructions](/about/membership-fee).

### Biweekly community zoom / Collaborate and coordinate

Every two weeks, Nordic-RSE members and contributors meet for a community Zoom call.
These sessions are open to anyone interested in helping shape the community’s activities.
Whether you can contribute a few minutes or a few days, your time and input are always welcome.

The purpose of the call is to:
- **Coordinate** upcoming events and initiatives
- **Share updates** and reports from past activities
- **Discuss ideas** and opportunities for collaboration

It’s a great way to stay involved and contribute to the direction of Nordic-RSE, whether you’re organizing, supporting, or just curious. 

- **When**: every second Thursday (starting 2025-08-21) at 13:00 Europe/Stockholm (14:00 Europe/Helsinki) ([convert to your time zone](https://arewemeetingyet.com/Helsinki/2021-09-02/14:00/w))
- **Where**: [Zoom link](https://aalto.zoom.us/j/62426845282) (Zoom ID 624 2684 5282)
- **Agenda and notes**: [here](https://hackmd.io/@nordic-rse/biweekly)

### Help lead the community

The Nordic-RSE association is guided by a board — a small group of volunteers who help keep things running smoothly. They take care of the essentials like budgeting, paperwork, and making sure the association stays on track.

The board meets when needed, usually twice a year, and works to support the broader goals of the community.

Once a year, all members of Nordic-RSE are invited to the annual meeting. It’s a chance to reflect on the past year, look ahead, and make decisions together. During the meeting, the board and other officials are elected, and the membership fee is set. If other topics are on the agenda, they’ll be shared in the invitation.

If you're curious about how things work behind the scenes or want to help shape the future of Nordic-RSE, you're warmly welcome to get involved. Whether you can offer a few minutes or a longer commitment, every contribution counts.
