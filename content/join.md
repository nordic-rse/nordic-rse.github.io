### Discover our events

The Nordic-RSE association organizes events to bring the community together, share knowledge, and inspire collaboration.

- **Conference**: Our main community gathering, featuring talks, discussions, and networking opportunities around research software engineering.
- **Seminars**: Previously held regularly to highlight projects and ideas – currently on hold, and we’re looking for new organizers to help bring them back.

Whether you're attending or helping to organize, our events are a great way to connect and contribute.


### Drop by for a coffee chat

Our weekly virtual coffee break is an informal space to meet others interested in research software engineering.

Everyone is welcome – no registration needed, just come and say hei/hej/moi/hæ/halló/tere/čau/labas/hi!

We chat about a mix of topics, mostly RSE-related, and it’s a great way to connect, share experiences, or simply listen in.

### Help lead the community

The Nordic-RSE association is guided by a board — a small group of volunteers who take care of the essentials like budgeting, paperwork, and making sure the association stays on track.

The board meets when needed, usually twice a year, and works to support the broader goals of the community.

Once a year, all members of Nordic-RSE are invited to the annual meeting. It’s a chance to reflect on the past year, look ahead, and make decisions together. During the meeting, the board and other officials are elected, and the membership fee is set. If other topics are on the agenda, they’ll be shared in the invitation.
