Many domains have migrated to Mastodon as of 2023.  Have Research
Software Engineers?  This post examines the situation, based on [this
post by rkdarst](https://fosstodon.org/@rkdarst/110146601969193973).
There are many contributors to this post as seen in [this
issue](https://github.com/nordic-rse/nordic-rse.github.io/pull/412).

Summary: not much yet

This post can be updated as we get more information/the situation
evolves, please send pull requests.


## RSE organizations

* US RSE: <https://fosstodon.org/@us_rse>
* DE RSE: <https://mastodon.social/@de_rse>
* Nordic RSE: <https://fosstodon.org/@nordic_rse>
* Society of RSE (UK/int): ??
* Research Software Alliance: <https://fosstodon.org/@researchsoft>
* Netherlands eScience Center: <https://akademienl.social/@eScienceCenter>
* RSE Midlands <https://mastodon.social/@RSE_Midlands>

## Other accounts to follow to seed your community

TODO: We should try to get a category in <https://fedi.directory/> rather than make our own list.


## Common hashtags

* **#RSEng** and **#RSE** have been seen, but #RSEng is preferred
  ([ref](https://fosstodon.org/@HeathrTurnr/110147262319789502).
  There doesn't seem to be much activity there.  #RSEng was
  the primary tag from from Twitter.  Sometimes #RSE is the people and
  #RSEng is the activity.

* **#HPC** has a fair community.

* **#OpenScience** can be found, in addition to **ResearchData** and
  **ResearchSoftware**.

* We propose **#SciComp** as a general "scientific computing" tag
  which can partly overlap with the above, but is more general to
  people interested in the computing part of science.

* There is the [a.gup.pe](https://a.gup.pe/u/researchsoftware) group
  "researchsoftware", which will boost any post tagging it, and can be
  used as a more targeted distribution group than tags
  ([ref](https://fosstodon.org/@mattasdata@qoto.org/110151591358979693)).
  We could also get a listing at <https://fedi.directory/>.


## RSE-focused Mastodon servers

There don't seem to be any servers specifically focused on the RSE
community.  Perhaps the closest one is the HPC community
<https://mast.hpc.social>, and we are invited to take part there
([ref](https://mast.hpc.social/@AlanSill/110147881007346377)).  There is overlap
between the HPC and RSE communities, and the initial community survey (ref)
for creation of the HPC.social Mastodon server showed a significant interest in
exchanging information on software topics.

Many
of the repliers used <https://fosstodon.org>.

One could ask if it's better to have a common server, or be more
distributed among the communities of other scientists to spread the
word.  There is a [list of academic/science related servers at
fedi-science](https://fediscience.org/server-list.html). The primary advantage
of a topic-driven server is a better local timeline, which will be populated with
the posts of everyone on that server.  While following hashtags/etc. is similar,
the local server makes this more natural.

There could be room for some RSE organization to set up a
RSE-focused server. (editor note: I, rkdarst, would somewhat prefer a
"scicomp"-focused mastodon server to bring together data, computing,
software, etc. people.  Yet, this is also too broad and nebulous and without
organizational backing so comments were negative on this idea.)


## Future

* Please send pull request with updates.
* We should contact SocRSE UK and ask them if they are interested in
  a Mastodon community.
