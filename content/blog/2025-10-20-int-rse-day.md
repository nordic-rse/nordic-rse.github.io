On International RSE Day, October 9th 2025, a group of 15 research software engineers and enthusiasts met up for lunch in the Helsinki region.
It was great to connect in person, to get to know each other, share common challenges, and explore ideas for future collaboration.

This was the start of a local network of RSEs and RSE-friendly folks in the capital area — and we hope it’s just the beginning! 
Silent enjoyer or an active co-creator, everyone is warmly invited to join Nordic-RSE and be part of our growing community. 

### What’s Next?

We’ve got some exciting events coming up:

**Nordic Basic Scientific Computing (No-BS Computing)**
February 2–4, 2026 in Otaniemi, Finland
-> A meetup for people who support academic research through computing and data expertise.

“This isn’t a time to advertise how great our tools and services are. It’s a time to look under the hood and talk about all 
the problems we encountered on the way (and the problems we expect in the future) so we can get better.”
The first day will feature a Finnish & Friends RSE meetup. 
Program wishes are welcome — registration opens soon!

**Nordic-RSE Conference 2026**
June 9–10, 2026 in Tromsø, Norway
Our main community event with sessions on tools, workflows, running RSE teams, and funding models. 
Submissions and registration will open early 2026, and you can even join the organizing team!

A huge thanks to the Software Sustainability Institute for sponsoring our lunch meetup and helping us celebrate the global RSE community!
