## Supercomputing conference 2023 in Denver

"SC23 Welcomed Over 14,000 Attendees and 438 Exhibitors Setting SC Records on
Both Counts" (from SC homepage: https://sc23.supercomputing.org/)

And indeed, a little overwhelming it was, and getting lost in the many
hallways of the Colorado conference center was one of the best icebreakers to
start talking to random people.  However, following mostly the smaller events
of the conference, like BoFs and workshops, it never really felt like there
was too many people.


### "I am HPC"

The topic of this years Supercomputing conference was "I am HPC" and this
showed in many of the keynotes and panels that were presented, as well as a
wonderful exhibition of of previous conference themes and highlights and some
posters highlighting different key peoples stories in HPC.

* Democratizing HPC


### Research Software Engineering

Even though this conference is so large, it is nice to see a lot of the same
people in sessions of interest. One of these groups are the Research Software
Engineers. US-RSE had a booth in the exhibition area and luckily collected a
list of all RSE-related talks and sessions of the whole conference, and
organized a social gathering.

* Research software and the people who make it


### Training (HPC and related)

Similar to above, you meet a lot of the same people in training related
sessions.

* Pathfinding in HPC education
* Best


### Own contributions

Our own contirbutions were mixed. We submitted one tutorial which would have
been about showing the CodeRefinery way of providing hybrid training in FAIR
research software development practices, which got rejected, due to being not
timely and thought through enough (but in total did not get too bad reviews).
Samantha co-submitted a panel on HPC learning pathways, which also got
rejected, due to there being too many similar submissions. But then we also
had some submissions that actually were part of the program:
* Radovan presented Research Software Hour, a XXX
* Samantha was part of a workshop panel on training and mentoring, based on CodeRefinery experiences (workshoplink XXX)
* Samantha co-organized a BoF session on HPC learning pathways, which was a super interesting experience.
