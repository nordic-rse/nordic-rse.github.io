## SuperComputing conference 2023 in Denver

"SC23 Welcomed Over 14,000 Attendees and 438 Exhibitors Setting SC Records on
Both Counts" (from [SC homepage](https://sc23.supercomputing.org/)).

And indeed, a little overwhelming it was, and getting lost in the many
hallways of the Colorado conference center was one of the best icebreakers to
start talking to random people.  However, following mostly the smaller events
of the conference, like BoFs and workshops, it never really felt too big or anonymous.

It was sometimes difficult to choose between multiple relevant and interesting
sessions happening at the same time. But we also tried to "parallelize" and
below we summarize our impressions and notes.


### "I am HPC"

The topic of this years SuperComputing conference was "I am HPC" and this
showed in many of the keynotes and panels that were presented, as well as a
wonderful exhibition of of previous conference themes and highlights and some
posters highlighting different key people stories in HPC.


### Democratizing HPC

This was a great workshop and we had the chance to see two outstanding
presentations (while unfortunately missing the other presentations in this
session when jumping to other sessions and meetings):

- [The History and Future of Making HPC Technologies Accessible to the Wider Community](https://sc23.conference-program.com/presentation/?id=misc335&sess=sess432) by Al Geist.
- [Democratizing Science through Equitable Access to Computing and Data](https://sc23.conference-program.com/presentation/?id=misc339&sess=sess432) by  Manish Parashar.

The second presentation cited this important document: [The Missing Millions](https://www.rti.org/publication/missing-millions/fulltext.pdf).


### Research Software Engineering

Even though this conference is so large, it is nice to see a lot of the same
people in sessions of interest. One of these groups are the Research Software
Engineers. US-RSE had a booth in the exhibition area and luckily collected a
list of all RSE-related talks and sessions of the whole conference, and
organized a social gathering.

[Scientific Software and the People Who Make it Happen: Building Communities
of Practice (SC 2023
BOF)](https://betterscientificsoftware.github.io/swe-cse-bof/2023-11-sc23-bof/)
was a second edition of this BoF ([previous
editions](https://betterscientificsoftware.github.io/swe-cse-bof/)) with a
welcoming community and interesting and inspiring lightning talks.


### Training (HPC and related)

Similar to above, you meet a lot of the same people in training related
sessions.

* Pathfinding in HPC education
* Best

Interesting resources we learned about:
- Cornell virtual workshop: https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/
- Digital Research Skills Australasia: https://dresa.org.au/
- https://hpc-ed.github.io/
- https://bssw-tutorial.github.io/

Example for how a learning roadmap could be presented: <https://roadmap.sh/>.


### Fun ideas for outreach and teaching HPC

Ideas/suggestions/inspirations collected at various workshops and BoFs:

- Nice example to practice parallel programming with randomness:
  [Nagelâ€“Schreckenberg model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagel%E2%80%93Schreckenberg_model).
  Try to make it reproducible and parallel.
- Parallel color-by-number.
- Parallel puzzle solving.
- Teach machine learning with tic-tac-toe as example with reinforced learning.
- Distributing a problem with coloring.
- Practice parallelization by sorting objects into buckets with several
  people.
- Scheduler explained with Tetris.
- Results from Outreach BoF: <https://tinyurl.com/outreach-activity-design>


### Own contributions

Two of our proposals were not accepted but nevertheless we were fortunate to participate in three very inspiring sessions.

We submitted one tutorial which would have
been about showing the CodeRefinery way of providing hybrid training in FAIR
research software development practices.
However, the proposal was not accepted
due to being not
timely and thought through enough (but in total did not get too bad reviews).

Samantha co-submitted a panel on HPC learning pathways, which was not accepted either,
due to there being too many similar submissions. But then we also
had some submissions that actually were part of the program:
* Radovan presented [Research Software Hour](https://betterscientificsoftware.github.io/swe-cse-bof/2023-11-sc23-bof/01-bast-researchsoftwarehour.pdf), at [Scientific Software and the People Who Make it Happen: Building Communities of Practice (SC 2023 BOF)](https://betterscientificsoftware.github.io/swe-cse-bof/2023-11-sc23-bof/).
* Samantha was part of a workshop panel on training and mentoring, based on CodeRefinery experiences (workshoplink XXX)
* Samantha co-organized a BoF session on HPC learning pathways, which was a super interesting experience.
