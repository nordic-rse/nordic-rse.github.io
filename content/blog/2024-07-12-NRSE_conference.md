In the end of May 2024 the Nordic-RSE community met for the first time in-person on the Otaniemi campus of Aalto university in Espoo, Finland. Originally planned to happen in Stockholm in 2020, we were happy to finally get together as a community. While Nordic-RSE has existed before, this conference in many ways was also a bit of a kick-off for the association.

The team behind the scenes consisted of volunteers from Sweden, Finland and Norway which was working on the conference preparations for about six months. We are incredibly greatful for the sponsorship we received from the Software Sustainability Institute and Aalto University. Discussions with organizers from other RSE conferences, such as RSECon and US-RSE, helped us a lot to prepare this event for this event. Thank you so much!

The team had prepared the event to start with an informal introduction session where everyone of the 28 participants could create their own name tag and get to know each other.

Participants came from six countries (FI, NO, SE, UK, DK, EE) and levels ranging from student to researcher and RSE to RSE leader.

Matteo Tomasini, the chair of Nordic-RSE opened the conference officially after a lunch break which already started lively discussions among the participants. He introduced Nordic-RSE as well as the path that led us to finally having this conference.

Keeping the conference in Finland, of course there had to be a Sauna evening as well! So we met for dinner on the campus brewery and afterwards moved across the street to sauna where the bright summer evening later ended.

Marting O'Reilly from the Turing institute in UK represented the Software Sustainability Institute with a keynote on Friday morning on the growth of Research Software Engineering and its vital role in research. 

Other conference talks ranged from experience reports from leading / starting an RSE group from Aalto, Arctic university in Troms√∏ and NTNU to tool presentations and demos. You can find all abstracts of the conference in the [Nordic-RSE conference 2024 book of abstracts](https://nordic-rse.org/events/2024-in-person-conference/nordic-2024-book-of-abstracts.pdf).

After the coffeebreak we continued with discussions, the first discussion started with another introduction round, this time focusing on the relation to RSE and how supported everyone feels in their organization. After that we split into groups and discussed around the question "why should an organization have RSEs". The results of these discussions were summarized in another [blogpost titled "Small steps towards sustainable and open research"](https://nordic-rse.org/blog/why-rse/).

In the last disucssion of the conference we started collecting feedback and planning the next conference. Nordic-RSE conference 2025 will be arranged in Gothenburg and you can be part of the planning team by joining the discussion in the [Nordic-RSE-2025 repository](https://github.com/nordic-rse/nordic-rse-2025).

During the whole conference we had an open board to collect ideas for logos for Nordic-RSE. Currently the Nordic-RSE association uses the general RSE society logo with Nordic added before it. However, the community agrees that it would be nice to have something of our own.

We would like to thank all participants and organizers of the conference for a successful event and hope to see many of you next year in Gothenburg, Sweden!
