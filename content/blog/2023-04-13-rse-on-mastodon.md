Many domains have migrated to Mastodon as of 2023.  Have Research
Software Engineers?  This post examines the situation, based on [this
post by rkdarst](https://fosstodon.org/@rkdarst/110146601969193973)

Summary: not much yet

This post can be updated as we get more information/the situation
evolves, please send pull requests.


## RSE organizations

* US RSE: <https://fosstodon.org/@us_rse>
* DE RSE: <https://fosstodon.org/@de_rse@mastodon.social>
* Nordic RSE: <https://fosstodon.org/@nordic_rse>
* Society of RSE (UK/int): ??
* ... ?


## Other accounts to follow to seed your community

TODO (should we join some other list instead of make a new one here?)


## Common hashtags

* **#RSEng and #RSE** have been seen, but #RSEng is preferred
  ([ref](https://fosstodon.org/@HeathrTurnr/110147262319789502) (same
  as Twitter).  There doesn't seem to be much activity there.

* **#HPC** has a fair community.

* **#OpenScience** can be found, in addition to **ResearchData** and
  **ResearchSoftware**.

* We propose **#SciComp** for as a general "scientific computing" tag
  which can partly overlap with the above, but is more general to
  people interested in the computing part of science.

* There is the [a.gup.pe](https://a.gup.pe/u/researchsoftware) group
  "researchsoftware", which will boost any post tagging it, and can be
  used as a more targeted distribution group than tags
  ([ref](https://fosstodon.org/@mattasdata@qoto.org/110151591358979693)).
  We could also get a listing at <https://fedi.directory/>.


## RSE-focused Mastodon servers

There don't seem to be any servers specifically focused on the RSE
community.  Perhaps the closest one is the HPC community
<https://mast.hpc.social>, and we are invited to take part there
([ref](https://mast.hpc.social/@AlanSill/110147881007346377)).  Many
of the repliers used <https://fosstodon.org>.

One could ask if if's better to have a common server, or be more
distributed among the communities of other scientists to spread the
word.  There is a [list of academic/science related servers at
fedi-science](https://fediscience.org/server-list.html).

There could be room for some RSE organization to set up a
RSE-focused server. (editor note: I, rkdarst, would somewhat prefer a
"scicomp"-focused mastodon server to bring together data, computing,
software, etc. people.)


## Future

* Please send pull request with updates.
* We should contact SocRSE UK and ask them if they are interested in
  a Mastodon community.
