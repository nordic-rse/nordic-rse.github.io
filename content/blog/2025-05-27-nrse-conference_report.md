# Nordic-RSE 2025: That’s a Wrap!

The Nordic-RSE conference is for anyone passionate about research software engineering (RSE) - whether you write research tools, support scientific software, or are just curious about the field. We built this event to be a space where people can learn, connect, and share knowledge.

And that’s exactly what happened in Gothenburg this May.

## A Look at the Numbers

This year, we welcomed **45 participants** to the Humanisten building at Gothenburg University over two full days (May 20–21, 9–17 CET). We had a packed program, with:

* **1 keynote talk**
* **14 talks**
* **3 discussion sessions**
* **2 tutorials**
* **4 posters**


## What We Talked About

The range of topics was wide and reflected the diversity of interests within the Research (Software) Engineering enthusiasts community in the Nordics. To name just a few:

* Open Science
* Design patterns in code
* A bit of the history behind free and open source software
* Vim (yes, really!)
* 3D visualization techniques
* Peer review processes for reproducible research software
* RSE group structures, funding and career paths
* Data processing and (3D) visualization with game engines and other tools
* Training experiences in RSE and adjacent fields
* Data handling tools and techniques 
* Graphical tools for working with supercomputers

And then there were all the spontaneous conversations - during lunch breaks, over coffee, and at the conference dinner - covering even more ground.

## Getting There

The lead-up to the conference was its own journey. Early on, we also ran a conference info event in form of an interview with the conference chair and local chair, which we summarizes as a [blog post titled "Join Us at Nordic-RSE conference 2025: A Home for Research Software Enthusiasts!"](https://nordic-rse.org/blog/conf-info-event/). Abstract submission was open until March 16, and we hosted a dedicated “Night of Unfinished Abstracts” on March 12 to help people shape their ideas and get peer support finalizing their abstracts and ideas.  Registration ran until early May, all through our [website](https://nordic-rse.org/nrse2025/).


## Staying Involved

The conference might be over, but we’re always looking for ways to keep the momentum going - especially online.
Have a suggestion for a seminar speaker? Got a topic you’d like to present? Want to help organize next time?
