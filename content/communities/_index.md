# The community of research software engineers in the Nordics

We have a small but growing community distributed across the Nordic
countries (and even beyond).


## RSE groups in Nordic countries

To create a Nordic network of RSEs, we are interested in listing RSE
groups, teams, and local communities.  They may be based in (for
example) universities, national labs, research institutes, academic
departments, or university IT organisations.  If you are organized in
such a group or would like to be added here, please contact us.

- [Aalto Scientific Computing](https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/), Aalto University, Finland
- [IEDL](https://iedl.no) - Industrial Ecology Digital Lab at NTNU Trondheim, Norway
- [NTNU Trondheim RSE Community](http://rse.org.ntnu.no/), Norway
- [UIT](https://research-software.uit.no/) - The Arctic University of Norway, Norway

### Add yourself to the map

You can add yourself or your group to this map by sending a pull request changing the
[data file](https://github.com/nordic-rse/map/blob/main/data.yml).

Who can be included?  We don't strictly define it, but welcome anyone who feels a connection to
the research software engineering spirit.  You don't
have to have an "RSE" job title, or even be recognized
for your software expertise, but you should feel it
relates to your current or future career somehow.

To add yourself, please read our [map
documentation](https://github.com/nordic-rse/map/blob/main/README.md).
