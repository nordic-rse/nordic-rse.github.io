# The community of research software engineers in the Nordics

There are several ways of being a member of the Nordic RSE community. None of
these numbers count everyone, but here are some details
 - Our [Zulip stream](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com) has about 250 members
 - Around 70 have signed up to our mailing list or become members
 - We are aware of [3 local RSE groups](local). See the
   [local communities](local) page for details.

### How to get added

You can add yourself or your group to this map by sending a pull request changing the
[data file](https://github.com/nordic-rse/map/blob/main/data.yml).

Who can be included?  We don't strictly define it right
now, but welcome anyone who feels a connection to
the research software engineering spirit.  You don't
have to have an "RSE" job title, or even be recognized
for your software expertise, but you should feel it
relates to your current or future career somehow.

[Here](https://github.com/nordic-rse/map/blob/main/README.md)
you find documentation about the required and optional data fields.
