# The community of research software engineers in the Nordics

There are several ways of being a member of the Nordic-RSE community. None of
these numbers count everyone, but here are some details (as of Winter 2025)
 - Our [Zulip stream](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com) has about 530 members
 - Around 100 have signed up to our mailing list or become members

## RSE groups in Nordic countries

Research software engineering groups provide a home for research programmers
who collaborate with researchers on multiple research projects.
Typically, a group of RSEs contract out their work to different people
who need it, but we are also interested in groups with significant
internal RSE work.

To create a Nordic network of RSEs, we are
interested in listing RSE groups, teams, and local communities.  They
may be based in (for example) universities, national labs, research
institutes, academic departments, or university IT organisations.

If you are organized in such a group please contact us.
We are aware of these Nordic-RSE groups:

- [Aalto Scientific Computing](https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/), Aalto University, Finland
- [IEDL](https://iedl.no) - Industrial Ecology Digital Lab at NTNU Trondheim, Norway
- [NTNU Trondheim RSE Community](http://rse.org.ntnu.no/), Norway
- [UIT](https://research-software.uit.no/) - The Arctic University of Norway, Norway

### How to get added

You can add yourself or your group to this map by sending a pull request changing the
[data file](https://github.com/nordic-rse/map/blob/main/data.yml).

Who can be included?  We don't strictly define it right
now, but welcome anyone who feels a connection to
the research software engineering spirit.  You don't
have to have an "RSE" job title, or even be recognized
for your software expertise, but you should feel it
relates to your current or future career somehow.

Please read our [map documentation](https://github.com/nordic-rse/map/blob/main/README.md) about the required and optional data fields.
