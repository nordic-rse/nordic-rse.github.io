# RSE groups in Nordic countries

Research software engineering groups provide a home for research programmers
who collaborate with researchers on multiple research projects.
Typically, a group of RSEs contract out their work to different people
who need it, but we are also interested in groups with significant
internal RSE work.

To create a Nordic network of RSEs, we are
interested in listing RSE groups, teams, and local communities.  They
may be based in (for example) universities, national labs, research
institutes, academic departments, or university IT organisations.

If you are organized in such a group please contact us.
