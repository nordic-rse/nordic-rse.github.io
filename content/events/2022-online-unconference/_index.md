*This announcement was modified since it was first published!*

**Save the dates!**.

Our first Nordic-RSE online unconference was a success and we are pleased to announce that we are planning the next Nordic-RSE unconference which will be held online on October 18-19 2022 (dates will be confirmed soon).

Nordic-RSE invites anyone who develop software or tools and are driven by research/engineering in either academia or industry.

**It is a great opportunity to network, share knowledge and experiences with your peers.**

The program will consist mainly of **your contributions** and we encourage you to submit a short abstract for a
discussion topic, talk, demonstration, or any other type of program you would
like to run beforehand (instructions below). But we will also collect on-site suggestions for contributions. No need to plan ahead!

Stay tuned for updates!

## Format and scope

We would like this event to be an informal space for exchanging ideas and experiences, learning something new, and networking with people of the same interest group. You do not have to be a Research Software Engineer or a Researcher or a Software Engineer nor do you have to be in or be related to the Nordics. Everyone interested in RSE activities is welcome and encouraged to participate and shape the event to what you would like it to be!

The Nordic-RSE team will provide support and infrastructure and give a short overview of the Nordic-RSE activities.


## Contributing

You can contribute not only with sessions you would like to present or lead but
also by **requesting what session you would like to happen** and **helping others organizing their sessions**.
You can do this by commenting [here](https://github.com/nordic-rse/conference-contributions/issues).

As an informal event, we welcome *any kind of contribution* which respects the [Code of Conduct](https://nordic-rse.org/about/code-of-conduct/code-of-conduct).
If you have an idea you would like to discuss for the event, we encourage you to submit an issue [here](https://github.com/nordic-rse/conference-contributions/issues/new?template=unconference-contribution.md&title=Unconference+event) to discuss with the community and secure a place in the program.
No idea yet? - No problem, we will also accept last minute contributions during the event.

Please also have a look at our [time slot suggestions](https://github.com/nordic-rse/conference-contributions/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/unconference-contribution.md).

Here are some examples to spark ideas:
- *Discussion topics*: is software, research software community or research software engineer something close to your heart? Come chatting with other enthusiasts!
- *Demonstrations:* show us some tools or software that you like
- *Workshop or [ReproHacks](https://reprohack.github.io/reprohack-hq/)* (max 3 hours in a day)
- *Talks*: teach us something new
- *On-going projects*: share with others something unfinished and almost working that you would like to get feedback on
- *Something else*: is there something you would like to share with others that does not fit any of the previous points? We are looking forward to hearing about it!

Another great way to get inspiration is to check what we have done last year during the first [Nordic-RSE Unconference](https://nordic-rse.org/events/2021-online-unconference/).

Ready to submit your idea? - Please use the [unconference contribution issue template](https://github.com/nordic-rse/conference-contributions/issues/new?template=unconference-contribution.md&title=Unconference+event) to let us know. It does not have to be polished yet, but so that the community gets the idea. We can polish it together if you want to :)

You may also come and chat with us in the [Zulip chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/213720-nordic-rse), where we can figure out contributions together.

If you want to be part of the published program, we kindly ask you to **submit your idea by October 1st 2022** via any of the above mentioned channels.
And remember, no stress, if you cannot submit anything before the event, you will still have the chance to add your contribution live during the event. But the earlier we know, the easier it is for us to schedule the contributions.

By submitting a contribution you agree that:
   - your name and abstract of the contribution will be published in our program
   - your contribution respects the [Code of Conduct](https://nordic-rse.org/about/code-of-conduct)
