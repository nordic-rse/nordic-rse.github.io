### Scope

This is our second Nordic-RSE unconference, held online **October 18-19,
2022**, 13:00 - 16:00 CEST (with optional social time). We invite research
software engineers and **everyone who develops software or tools** and are
driven by research/engineering in either academia or industry.  It is a great
opportunity to network, share knowledge and experiences with your peers.  We
would like this event to be an informal space for exchanging ideas and
experiences, learning something new, and networking with people of the same
interest group.

Possible topics/formats (or check what we have done [last year](/events/2021-online-unconference/)):
- *Discussion topics*: is software, research software community or research software engineer something close to your heart? Come chatting with other enthusiasts!
- *Demonstrations:* show us some tools or software that you like
- *Workshop or [ReproHacks](https://reprohack.github.io/reprohack-hq/)* (max 3 hours in a day)
- *Talks*: teach us something new
- *On-going projects*: share with others something unfinished and almost working that you would like to get feedback on
- *Something else*: is there something you would like to share with others that
  does not fit any of the previous points? We are looking forward to hearing
  about it!


### How it works

The program of the **unconference** will consist mainly of **your
contributions** and we encourage you to submit a short abstract for a
discussion topic, talk, demonstration, or any other type of program you would
like to run beforehand. But we will also collect on-site suggestions for
contributions.  And of course we will all follow a [Code of
Conduct](https://nordic-rse.org/about/code-of-conduct/).

You can also help us by [sharing the announcement with others](/events/2022-online-unconference/share/).
