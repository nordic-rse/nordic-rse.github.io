Our [first Nordic-RSE online unconference](/events/2021-online-unconference)
was a success and we are pleased to announce that we are planning the next
Nordic-RSE unconference which will be held online on **October 18-19, 2022**.

Nordic-RSE invites anyone who develop software or tools and are driven by
research/engineering in either academia or industry.
**It is a great opportunity to network, share knowledge and experiences with
your peers.**

The program will consist mainly of **your contributions** and we encourage you
to submit a short abstract for a discussion topic, talk, demonstration, or any
other type of program you would like to run beforehand (instructions below).
But we will also collect on-site suggestions for contributions. No need to plan
too much ahead! Stay tuned for updates!


## Registration

**PLEASE REGISTER** at <https://indico.neic.no/e/nordic-rse-2022>. At registration
time we will also ask you whether there is any discussion or presentation topic
that you would like see happen or help to facilitate.

## Format and scope

We would like this event to be an informal space for exchanging ideas and
experiences, learning something new, and networking with people of the same
interest group. You do not have to be a research software engineer or a
researcher or a software engineer nor do you have to be in or be related to the
Nordics. **Everyone interested in RSE activities is welcome** and encouraged to
participate and shape the event to what you would like it to be!

The Nordic-RSE team will provide:
- [Code of Conduct](https://nordic-rse.org/about/code-of-conduct/)
- Support and infrastructure and give a short overview of the Nordic-RSE activities
- Zoom (with breakout rooms for unconference sessions)
- Collaborative documents (HackMD)
- Streaming and recording (opt-in)
- Continuing conversation on our [Zulip chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/213720-nordic-rse)
  before, during, and after the event


## Contributing

You can contribute not only with sessions you would like to present or lead but
also by **requesting what session you would like to happen** and **helping
others organizing their sessions**.  You can do this by commenting
[here](https://github.com/nordic-rse/conference-contributions/issues).
As an informal event, we welcome *any kind of contribution* which respects the
[Code of
Conduct](https://nordic-rse.org/about/code-of-conduct/code-of-conduct).
Please also have a look at our [time slot suggestions](https://github.com/nordic-rse/conference-contributions/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/unconference-contribution.md).

Here are some examples to spark ideas:
- *Discussion topics*: is software, research software community or research software engineer something close to your heart? Come chatting with other enthusiasts!
- *Demonstrations:* show us some tools or software that you like
- *Workshop or [ReproHacks](https://reprohack.github.io/reprohack-hq/)* (max 3 hours in a day)
- *Talks*: teach us something new
- *On-going projects*: share with others something unfinished and almost working that you would like to get feedback on
- *Something else*: is there something you would like to share with others that
  does not fit any of the previous points? We are looking forward to hearing
  about it!

Another great way to get inspiration is to check what we have done last year
during the first [Nordic-RSE
Unconference](https://nordic-rse.org/events/2021-online-unconference/).

You may also come and chat with us in the [Zulip
chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/213720-nordic-rse),
where we can figure out contributions together.

By submitting a contribution you agree that:
- Your name and abstract of the contribution will be published in our program
- Your contribution respects the [Code of Conduct](https://nordic-rse.org/about/code-of-conduct)
