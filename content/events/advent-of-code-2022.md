# Advent of Code 2022

This year we will again work
[advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/)
challenges together. Join us on the [Zulip chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/305975-Advent-of.20Code).

The advent of code is a great way to learn a new programming language tohether
or brush up your software development skills. Each day we will chat about our
solutions, give some tips if you are stuck (provided at least one of us has
solved the problem) and just chat and have some fun.

See you on the [Zulip chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/305975-Advent-of.20Code) and in the Zoom meeting.
