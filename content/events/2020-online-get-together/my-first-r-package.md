Writing an R package has helped me leave my comfort zone and level up my R
programming skills. The code I write as a researcher is mostly single-user and
single-use. Writing and publishing code meant for others has helped me break
old habits and acquire useful new software engineering skills. R has a
streamlined ecosystem for package development that supports understanding and
adhering to best practices. I will talk about the things I have learned while
writing my first R package, why I think writing a package should be a rite of
passage for any aspiring research software engineer, and why R is a great tool
for this.
