In this short presentation I will discuss how we grew the CodeRefinery project
over the past 4 years and taught hundreds of students and researchers across
all disciplines in best practices in reproducible research software
engineering.

I will highlight how we transitioned from in-person workshops to online
training and the team effort which made it possible to scale the workshops to
almost 100 participants per event.
