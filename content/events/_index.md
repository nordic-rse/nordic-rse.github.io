## Advent of Code

Every year we try to do the

challenges and discuss their implementation in different languages. Join us on the [Zulip chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/305975-Advent-of-Code).

The advent of code is a great way to learn a new programming language tohether

solved the problem) and just chat and have some fun.
