[The International RSE Day](http://researchsoftware.org/council/intl-rse-day.html) is to celebrate Research Software Engineers around the world and raise awareness for the increasingly relevant discipline of Research Software Engineering.

The Nordic-RSE association is contributing to the International RSE day with an exciting program around community building and raising awareness for RSEs!

## Schedule

#### October 14th

(all times in CEST)

- All day, at anytime come and say hello in [https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com) in our [nordic-rse/international RSE day Oct 14 stream](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/213720-nordic-rse/topic/international.20RSE.20day.20Oct.2014). We do not have any registration form for this event but we would like to encourage our community to come along in zulip to say hello! 
- 09:00 Introduce yourself (2 hours come along helpdesk session in zulip chat)
  The goal of this session is to provide support to prepare a 1 min video about yourself:
     - your name, institution, RSE project you are working on e.g. what software are you contributing to (language, topic and whatever you can say in less than 1 minute!)

     All the videos will be published in our youtube channel and we will also make a "wall of fame" on the nordic-RSE website. 

     Nordic-RSE staff will provide helpdesk in our [nordic-rse/international RSE day Oct 14 stream](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/213720-nordic-rse/topic/international.20RSE.20day.20Oct.2014) so they can support you to prepare the video but of course, feel free to skip this session and send us directly the link to your 1 minute video!
     
     If you want to an example of what you can have in your 1mn video, have a look [here](https://vimeo.com/629975390). Once your video is ready, share the link with us on our [nordic-rse/international RSE day Oct 14 stream](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/213720-nordic-rse/topic/international.20RSE.20day.20Oct.2014).

- 11:00 Lunch break 
- 13:00 TIL ('Today I Learned')  session
     - This session is all about sharing the small things that we learn now and then, that others may also find useful.
     - You can find a growing collection of TIL on our Zulip #help/TIL channel that can serve as inspiration. 
     - The idea for this afternoon is to write blogs/documents about them to share them with the community via the Nordic-RSE website.
- 15:00 Wrap up and thank you to everyone!
