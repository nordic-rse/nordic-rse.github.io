[The International RSE Day](http://researchsoftware.org/council/intl-rse-day.html) is to celebrate Research Software Engineers around the world and raise awareness for the increasingly relevant discipline of Research Software Engineering.

The Nordic-RSE association is contributing to the International RSE day and we have prepared for you an exciting program!

## Schedule

#### October 14th

(all times in CEST)

- All day, at anytime come and say hello in [https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com) in our [nordic-rse/international RSE day Oct 14 stream](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/213720-nordic-rse/topic/international.20RSE.20day.20Oct.2014). We do not have any registration form for this event but we would like to encourage our community to come along in zulip to say hello! Once your 1 minute video about yourself is ready, share it in this stream too!
- 09:00 Introduce yourself (2 hours come along helpdesk session)
  The goal of this session is to provide support to prepare a 1 mn video about yourself:
     - your name, institution, RSE project you are working on e.g. what software are you contributing to (language, topic and whatever you can say in less than 1 minute!)

     All the videos will be published in our youtube channel and we will also make a "wall of fame" on the nordic-RSE website. 

     Nordic-RSE staff will provide helpdesk so they can support you to prepare the video but of course, feel free to skip this session and send us directly the link to your 1 minute video!

- 11:00 Lunch
- 13:00 TIL session
     - We have many topics covered in zulip. The idea is to write blogs/documents them on the Nordic-RSE website.
- 15:00 Wrap up and thank you to everyone!
