Are you developing software or tools that are driven by research/engineering in
either academia or industry?  Do you need to network, share knowledge and
experiences with your peers?  Then you came to the right page: Nordic-RSE
invites everyone interested to participate in Research Software Seminar Series:


## Timing

We aim at having a talk every month.
The time for each seminar will be set by the speaker.
We are inviting everyone to suggest topics and/or speakers for this series [here](https://github.com/nordic-rse/nordic-rse.github.io/issues).

## Format

As an example, events can be 60 min (40+20 discussion) or 30 min (15+15
discussion).  Events could be talks, demos, discussion, debates, and so on.
Events are hosted with HackMD for public asynchronous discussion.  We will
provide mentoring for speakers.

We would like this series to be an informal space also for exchanging ideas and
experiences, learning something new, and networking with people of the same
interest group. You do not have to be a Research Software Engineer or a
Researcher or a Software Engineer nor do you have to be in or be related to the
Nordics. Everyone interested in RSE activities is welcome and encouraged to
participate!

The Nordic-RSE team will provide support and infrastructure.

## Upcoming seminars

We will publish upcoming seminar topics and abstracts here as soon as they are confirmed.
You can see topics in planning and add your own suggestions on our [Issues page](https://github.com/nordic-rse/nordic-rse.github.io/issues).

### March 2023: What a Research Software Engineering group at a Nordic university look like

- Speaker: Richard Darst, [Aalto Scicomp](https://scicomp.aalto.fi/)
- 2023-03-15, 13:00 CET [convert to your time zome](https://arewemeetingyet.com/Helsinki/2023-03-15/14:00)
- Hackmd (contains connection details): <https://hackmd.io/@nordic-rse/seminar-march-2023>
- Abstract: What does a Research Software Engineering (RSE) group at a Nordic university look like?  Aalto RSE supports the whole university, and Richard Darst and other Aalto RSE members will discuss the history behind their team, the way it works, future prospects, and lessons for others. This talk will focus on the administrative side of things, and discussion will focus on what one should know to reproduce this work at other universities.
Aalto University is the leading technical university in Finland. Started in 2020, Aalto RSE now serves the entire university in computing, data, and software problems. They work as part of Science-IT, which is effectively the local "HPC team". They have good connections to the local IT Services, Data Agents, and other research services.

## Past seminars

We will publish past seminar topics and their recordings here as soon as they are available.

### November 2022: Chapel: Making Parallel Programming Productive, from laptops to supercomputers

- Speaker: [Brad Chamberlain](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~bradc/), HPE
- 2022-11-30, 16:00 CET [convert to your time zome](https://arewemeetingyet.com/Helsinki/2022-11-30/17:00)
- Hackmd (contains connection details): <https://hackmd.io/@nordic-rse/seminar-november-2022>
- Abstract:
Over the past few decades, a gulf has existed between 'mainstream' programming languages—like Python, Java, C++, Rust, or Swift—and  technologies used in practice for programming supercomputers—like MPI, OpenSHMEM, OpenMP, CUDA, OpenCL, or OpenACC.
This gulf results in making High Performance Computing something of a specialized skill that may not  be readily available to the general programmer or applied computational scientist.
In some ways, the problem has even gotten worse over time, as the end of Moore's law has led to building supercomputers using manycore processors and computational accelerators like GPUs.

In this talk, I will introduce [Chapel](https://chapel-lang.org/), an open-source language created to bridge this gulf.
Chapel strives to support code that is similarly readable/writeable as Python, yet without sacrificing the portability and scalable performance required to utilize supercomputers effectively. 
Specifically, I will provide motivation for Chapel, present some of its unique features and themes, introduce flagship applications of Chapel, and give a glimpse into our team's current priorities.


#### April 2022: Journal of Open Source Software – Developing a Software Review Community

- Speaker: [Arfon Smith](https://www.arfon.org/)
- 2022-04-27, 13 -- 14 CEST [convert to your time zone](https://arewemeetingyet.com/Helsinki/2022-04-27/14:00)
- [recording](https://youtu.be/Dvmi9tq550Q)
- Hackmd (contains connection details): <https://hackmd.io/@nordic-rse/joss-talk>
- Abstract: In this presentation, I'll introduce the Journal of Open Source Software, a community-run diamond open access journal for publishing open source software packages. I'll share some of the motivations behind the journal, how it works, and how the journal has evolved over the last six years of operations.

#### April 2022: Motivating specialist services in universities (or, "Starting a RSE group")

- Speaker: Richard Darst, [Aalto Scientific Computing](https://scicomp.aalto.fi/)
- 2022-04-06, 14 -- 15 CEST [convert to your time zone](https://arewemeetingyet.com/Helsinki/2022-04-06/15:00)
- Hackmd: <https://hackmd.io/@nordic-rse/starting-rse-group>
- Summary: I've gotten several requests about "what is your advice for
  starting a RSE service", and I will lead a discussion on this in the
  seminar series.

#### February 2022: The importance and role of community in open source

- Speaker: [Logan Kilpatrick](https://twitter.com/officiallogank), JuliaLang
- 2022-02-16, 17-18 CET [convert to your time zone](https://arewemeetingyet.com/Stockholm/2022-02-16/17:00)
- Hackmd (contains connection details): <https://hackmd.io/@nordic-rse/community_oss>

Open Source is more than code. In order for an Open Source project to thrive, it must put in place mechanism to attract and reward non-code contributions. In this talk, we will go over how the Julia community attracts and rewards these contributions as well as how other projects can learn from our experience.

#### January 2022: Developing and distributing in-house R-packages
- Speaker: [Athanasia Monika Mowinckel](https://drmowinckels.io/about/), University of Oslo
- 2022-01-20, 13-14 CET [convert to your timezone](https://arewemeetingyet.com/Stockholm/2022-01-20/13:00)
- Hackmd notes: <https://hackmd.io/@nordic-rse/R_packaging>

R is mainly a statistical programming language than has been around for more than 20 years. In recent years, it has seen a large resurge in popularity, especially amongst researchers, for its powerful statistical backbone and open source practice. But R can be unfamiliar and intimidating for researchers used to a purely GUI based statistical tool. This talk will center around how I have developed in-house R tools to clean and handle in-house data, and how I have distributed these to work on multiple platforms.

#### November: Blurring the lines: Singularity containerisation of SLURM orchestrators
- Speaker: Frankie Robertson, University of Jyväskylä
- 2021-11-23, 13-15 CET [convert to your timezone](https://arewemeetingyet.com/Stockholm/2021-11-23/13:00)
- Hackmd notes: <https://hackmd.io/@nordic-rse/singularity_containerization>
- [Recording](https://youtu.be/revklPtujtE)

While [SLURM](https://slurm.schedmd.com) itself provides tools for job
orchestration like job arrays, high level tools like
[Snakemake](https://snakemake.github.io/) and [Ray](https://www.ray.io/) are
cluster agnostic and can either make use of SLURM or run on a laptop. To make
Snakemake and Ray to run within Singularity, I present
[singreqrun](https://github.com/frankier/singreqrun), which works by requesting
the host runs programs on behalf of the container.

The talk doubles as an introduction to Snakemake and Ray. After some brief
background on the main tools (Singularity, SLURM, Snakemake and Ray), we
proceed to shell code-along to run the following examples:

 * Snakemake for heterogeneous (mixture of CPU and GPU nodes) video corpus
   processing + quick porting across HPC clusters
 * Snakemake for text corpus processing including using extra Singularity
   containers for utilities
 * Ray for hyperparameter search

I end the talk by opening for discussion. Is this a good approach? Can we
improve upon it?

#### October 2021: I/O profiling and optimization.
- Speaker: Simo Tuomisto, [Aalto Scientific
  Computing](https://scicomp.aalto.fi)
- Abstract: In computing, I/O bandwidth is just as much of a
  consumable resource as CPU and memory.  While on an individual scale
  on one's own computer, this is often not the most pressing
  consideration, on a cluster with shared storage (or very intensive
  individual projects) it is actually very important to consider.
  This talk presented lessons and tools that RSEs should have in
  their toolbox, as we have learned at Aalto Scientific Computing over
  the years.

#### August 2021: Package development in Julia

- Speaker: [Luca Ferranti](https://lucaferranti.github.io), University of Vaasa, Finland.
- 2021-08-18, 13-16 CEST [convert to your timezone](https://arewemeetingyet.com/Stockholm/2021-08-18/13:00).
- HackMD notes: <https://hackmd.io/@nordic-rse/package-development-julia>

[Julia](https://julialang.org/) is constantly gaining popularity both in academia and industry and it is thus an appealing programming language for research software engineers. This session will be a hands-on tutorial, which will cover the typical package development workflow in Julia. Topics covered include
  - Creating a package from scratch
  - Contributing to existing packages
  - Tools to test and debug your packages
  - Tools to document your packages

Moreover, Luca will share tips and tricks that have helped him making his workflow more efficient and hopefully will help you too.
The workshop will involve a lot of live coding and you are encouraged to follow along, check the setup instructions [here](https://hackmd.io/@nordic-rse/package-development-julia).
