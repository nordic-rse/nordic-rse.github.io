# Nordic-RSE meetings

We meet virtually for the following occasions:

## Virtual coffee break - weekly

We have a weekly informal coffee break at **9:00 CET/CEST (10 EET/EEST) every Thursday**. [Convert to your time zone](https://arewemeetingyet.com/Helsinki/2021-09-02/10:00/w)
The coffee break is an informal meeting, open for everyone to discuss with and listen to
others interested in research software engineering.  We currently have
no pre-decided topics, but never run out of things to say.

On each even week, as needed, we have a community planning meeting during the coffee break time, **9:00 CET/CEST (10 EET/EEST) every Thursday**. The agenda for the next meeting and the minutes of previous meetings are kept on [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@nordic-rse/biweekly).

## Taskforce meetings - randomly

Once in a while we have larger projects that would be too much to discuss in the community meetings. Then we form taskforces that meet separately. Lately we for example formed taskforces on the topics of website redesign and organization of the Research Software Seminar Series.

## Boardmeeting - when needed

The board of the association meets when required. The board handles necessary
official actions, paperwork and budgeting. The board also officially represents
the association.

## Association meeting - yearly

Once every year all members of the Nordic RSE association are invited to the
annual meeting. The annual meeting chooses the board and other officials, and
decides the annual membership fee. The annual meeting may also decide other
matters, but these will be introduced in the invitation.

The next Nordic-RSE annual meeting will be October 19 2023 at 14:00 -- 15:30 CEST. Agenda and connection details on hackmd <https://hackmd.io/@nordic-rse/annual_meeting_2023>.
