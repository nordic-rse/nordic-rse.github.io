# Nordic-RSE meetings

We meet virtually for the following occasions:


## Virtual coffee break (weekly)

We have a weekly informal coffee break at
**9:00 Europe/Stockholm (10 Europe/Helsinki) every Thursday**
([convert to your time zone](https://arewemeetingyet.com/Helsinki/2021-09-02/10:00/w)).

The coffee break is an informal meeting, open for everyone to discuss with and listen to
others interested in research software engineering.

## Community discussions (every second week)

During our biweekly community meeting we discuss what we, as Nordic-RSE can do to get RSE and RSE-minded people together to discuss the topics that interest us.
RSE in the Nordics is not well known (yet), so a big part of discussions are also around how we can make it more known. There is no requirement to join the meetings, other than an interest in what we are doing. 
Anyone is very welcome to provide some of their time to advance these goals, be it minutes or days. 

Currently these discussions happen during the coffee break time, every other week **9:00 CET/CEST (10 EET/EEST) every Thursday**. The time
for the next meeting is added to the agenda on [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@nordic-rse/biweekly) when decided. You can also find minutes of previous meetings there.

## Board meeting (when needed)

The board of the association meets when required. The board handles necessary
official actions, paperwork and budgeting. The board also officially represents
the association.


## Association meeting (yearly)

Once every year all members of the Nordic RSE association are invited to the
annual meeting. The annual meeting chooses the board and other officials, and
decides the annual membership fee. The annual meeting may also decide other
matters, but these will be introduced in the invitation.
