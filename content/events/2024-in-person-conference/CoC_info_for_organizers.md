# Code of Conduct Information for Organizers

> This code of conduct is copied and adapted from the example policy at the
> [Geek Feminism wiki](https://geekfeminism.wikia.org/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy),
> created by the Ada Initiative and other volunteers (CC-0 license).
> The procedure for reporting harassment has been adopted from the Ada Initiative's guide titled
> ["workshop anti-harassment/Responding to Reports"](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Responding_to_reports).


Please read this before organizing a Nordic-RSE event. This page describes how we
enforce security and the code of coduct in a Nordic-RSE event.


### Warnings

Any member of conference organizer or code of conduct committee member can issue
a verbal warning to a participant that their behavior violates the conference's
anti-harassment policy.

Warnings should be reported to secretary@nordic-rse.org as soon as practical.
This ensures that other organizers know about the warning and creates a record.

The report should include:
 * Identifying information (name/badge number) of the participant
 * The time you issued the warning
 * The behavior that was in violation
 * The approximate time of the behavior (if different than the time of warning)
 * The circumstances surrounding the incident
 * Your identity
 * Other people involved in the incident


### Presentations

Presentations or similar events should not be stopped for one-time gaffes or minor problems,
although a member of conference staff should speak to the presenter afterward. However, staff
should take immediate action to politely and calmly stop any presentation or event that
repeatedly or seriously violates the anti-harassment policy. For example, simply say "I'm
sorry, this presentation cannot be continued at the present time" with no further explanation.


### Taking reports

When taking a report from someone experiencing harassment you should record what they say and
reassure them they are being taken seriously, but avoid making specific promises about what
actions the organizers will take. Ask for any other information if the reporter has not
volunteered it (such as time, place) but do not pressure them to provide it if they are
reluctant. Even if the report lacks important details such as the identity of the person
taking the harassing actions, it should still be recorded and passed along to the appropriate
staff member(s). If the reporter desires it, arrange for an escort by conference staff or a
trusted person, contact a friend, and contact local law enforcement. Do not pressure the
reporter to take any action if they do not want to do it. Respect the reporter's privacy by
not sharing unnecessary details with others, especially individuals who were not involved with
the situation or non-staff members.

The report should include:
 * Identifying information (name/badge number) of the participant
 * The time you issued the warning
 * The behavior that was in violation
 * The approximate time of the behavior (if different than the time of warning)
 * The circumstances surrounding the incident
 * Your identity
 * Other people involved in the incident


### Expulsion

A participant may be expelled by the decision of the conference organizers or code of coduct
committee member, for whatever reasons they deem sufficient. However, here are some general
guidelines for when a participant should be expelled:

 * A [third] offense resulting in a warning from staff
 * Continuing to harass after any "No" or "Stop" instruction
 * A pattern of harassing behavior, with or without warnings
 * A single serious offense (e.g., punching or groping someone)
 * A single obviously intentional offense (e.g., taking up-skirt photos)

Venue security and local authorities should be contacted when appropriate.


Phone number for venue security: NNN NNN NNNN


### Public statements

As a general rule, conference staff should not make any public statements about the behavior
of individual people during or after the conference.

In general, consult with other staff members when possible but act when necessary.
