## What is it?

Do you enjoy talking software? Learning tricks about your favorite programming languages? Solving interesting coding 
problems? Sharing your experiences with other likeminded people? Welcome to the first ever Nordic RSE in person 
conference! We believe you might really like it here. 

We are an association of professionals developing and using software for the needs of research. As such we aim to create 
a community of researchers, engineers, developers, digital experts and more, to talk about topics that are often overlooked 
in classical academic conferences. The focus of our conference is not on results of research, but rather on the tools that 
underlie those results. Additionally, we hope to foster a rich network of exchanges and conversations surrounding the 
practices of software development in research. 

Most research is already built on a foundation of sofware tools and the quality and reliability of those tools is key to
producing reliable results. And the importance of software keeps growing. In this conference we want to talk about what
pipelines you develop and use for your research, and how you use it, the software you develop, and how you got about
developing it.

### How you can help

 - [Submit a contribution!](/events/2024-in-person-conference#call-for-contributions) In line with our previous online unconferences, our meetings are driven by our participants! What do you want to talk about? 
 - Encourage your colleagues to submit a contribution and/or join our association. Since the term RSE is still fairly new, they might not know about it yet and be hesitant to submit something. 
 - [Share the announcement with others](/events/2024-in-person-conference/). 
 - Do you want to volunteer and help us run our first in person conference? [Join us or get in touch with us](/about/governance/contact.md)!


## Call for Contributions

We invite you to submit contributions **by March 22nd**, on any topics related to research software. Whether you are using it or developing it yourself,
we are interested in your experience and expertise. Topics are divided roughly into 3 sessions, "Best Practices", "Technical" and
"Soft Skills". But don't let this limit you, many topics are welcome. Just submit your idea and we can discuss and find a spot for it!

All formats of communication are welcome (or check what we have done [in the unconference](/events/2023-online-unconference/)):
- *Discussion topics* (15-20 minutes): is software, research software community or research software engineering something close to your heart? Come chat with other enthusiasts!
- *Demonstrations:* show us some tools or software that you like
- *Workshops or [ReproHacks](https://reprohack.github.io/reprohack-hq/)* (max 3 hours in a day)
- *Talks* (20 minutes including 5 min questions): teach us something new
- *On-going projects*: share something unfinished or almost working that you would like to get feedback on
- *Something else*: is there something you would like to share that
  does not fit any of the previous points? We are looking forward to hearing
  about it!

The open (or 'unconference') session will include on day contributions, topics that arise during the conference.

And of course we will all follow a [Code of Conduct](https://nordic-rse.org/about/code-of-conduct/).
