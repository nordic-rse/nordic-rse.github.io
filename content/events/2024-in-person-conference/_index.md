## What is it?

Do you enjoy talking software? Learning tricks about your favorite programming languages? Solving interesting coding 
problems? Sharing your experiences with other likeminded people? Welcome to the first ever Nordic RSE in person 
conference! We believe you might really like it here. 

We are an association of professionals developing and using software for the needs of research. As such we aim to create 
a community of researchers, engineers, developers, digital experts and more, to talk about topics that are often overlooked 
in classical academic conferences. The focus of our conference is not on results of research, but rather on the tools that 
underlie those results. Additionally, we hope to foster a rich network of exchanges and conversations surrounding the 
practices of software development in research. 

Most research is already built on a foundation of sofware tools and the quality and reliability of those tools is key to
producing reliable results. And the importance of software keeps growing. In this conference we want to talk about what
pipelines you develop and use for your research, and how you use it, the software you develop, and how you got about
developing it.


## Where

On the [campus of Aalto
University](https://maps.app.goo.gl/caL3qyHPKrhX3HHJ8) in Otaniemi,
Espoo, Finland (note: the address is Konemiehentie 1, Espoo, but
Google doesn't direct you to the right building if you enter this
address.  See practical info).


### How you can help

 - Encourage your colleagues to submit a contribution and/or join our association. Since the term RSE is still fairly new, they might not know about it yet and be hesitant to submit something. 
 - [Share the announcement with others](/events/2024-in-person-conference/). 
 - Do you want to volunteer and help us run our first in person conference? [Join us or get in touch with us](/about/governance/contact.md)!


## Contributions and themes

The call for contributions is now closed, and the program will be published soon, check this space! For now, you can take a look at the [book of accepted abstracts](./nordic-2024-book-of-abstracts.pdf).

We will have a plenary program including talks about some technical demonstrations of computational techologies, the future of research software engineers, breaking (programming) language barriers, and more! In particular, don't miss our invited speaker Martin O'Reilly, from the Software Sustainability Institute, who will talk about the growth of Research Software Engineering and its vital role in research! 

We will also make sure to get enough time to network and enjoy our time as a community: our social times will include coffee breaks, a dinner and a sauna on the evening of Day 1.

And of course we will all follow a [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct/).

### Finding our buildings/rooms

Click on the respective marker on the map for arrival instructions/map
app links.  Check your email for a contact phone number if you need
help.


### Other activities

Our plan includes lunches, conference dinner, sauna.

[Wikivoyage Helsinki](https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Helsinki) is
usually pretty accurate and has information about the area and other
sights to see.


### Hotels

There are various hotels within easy walking distance.  We don't have
any particular discounts.  "Radison Blu Otaniemi" is the default
location for university visitors.  Other hotels in Helsinki downtown
are fine also, the metro trip is 11 minutes (and costs ~3 euros).


### Transportation

tldr: Aalto University is at the "Aalto University" metro stop.  An "ABC"
ticket manages the train from airport AND metro (and trams, busses,
etc).

**Air:** Helsinki Airport.  Between the airport
and Aalto University, plan for max 1.5 hours (less than one hour is
possible if you are efficient).  From the airport, follow signs to the
train station.  Buy a ticket for zones ABC, this will get you all the
way to the university (see public transport).  Take the first train
that comes (either way gets to downtown in about the same time).  Walk
to the main station and down to the metro station.  Take a metro
to the stop Aalto University (direction Tapiola or Kivenlahti), then
continue in section "public transport"

**Ferry:** From Tallinn or Stockholm, there are ferries. Expect well
under an hour to get from the ferry harbors to Aalto University.  Take
trams to the metro, but from each harbor walking to the metro is
reasonable (not too far and nice walks).
(Some attendees are also attending the Nordic e-infrastructure
Conference in Tallinn on 27-29 May, they will be taking ferries from
Tallinn the evening of 29 May.  More info to be announced)

**Bus, Train, etc. within Finland:** You probably know how to get to
the center of Helsinki.  Follow public transit below.

**Private vehicle:** There isn't free parking, but there are paid lots
around.

**Public transport:** The public transport system is good and easy to
use.  The metro stop name is "Aalto University", and the A entrance may be
slightly easier to use.  Tickets can be bought at ticket machines, or
via the "HSL App".  Aalto University is in the zone B, downtown is in
the zone A, the airport in zone C, and tickets last a bit more than an
hour and work on any public bus, train, metro, or tram (and as many
transfers as you need). AB zone tickets cost 2.95€.

If coming from airport: use single tickets, day tickets not worth it
even with one extra trip to/from downtown.
