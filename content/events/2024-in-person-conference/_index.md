# Nordic-RSE in person conference 2024 <span style="color: gray;">#NordicRSEconf</span>


**May 30-31**

Registration will open in January 2024


## What is it?

This is the first Nordic RSE in person conference. We are an association of researchers who use software and people who write
that software. So this is not like most academic conferences in that the focus is not on the results of research, but rather
on the tools that underlie those results.

Most research is already built on a foundation of sofware tools and the quality and reliability of those tools is key to
producing reliable results. And the importance of software keeps growing. In this conference we want to talk about what software
you are use for your research and how you use it, the software you develop and how you go about developing it.


## Where

At Aalto University, Espoo, Finland.


### How you can help

 - Submit a contribution! The conference will be more interesting with your contribution on the agenda.

## Call for Contributions

The call for contributions is open at URL_HERE.

We invite you to submit contributions on any topics related to software. Whether you are using it for research or developing it yourself,
we are interested in your experience and expertice. Topics are divided roughly into 3 sessions, "Best Practices", "Techical" and
"Soft Skills". Don't let this limit you, any topics are welcome.

All formats of communication are welcome (or check what we have done [in the unconference](/events/2023-online-unconference/)):

- *Something else*: is there something you would like to share with others that
