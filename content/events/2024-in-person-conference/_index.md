## What is it?

Do you enjoy talking software? Learning tricks about your favorite programming languages? Solving interesting coding 
problems? Sharing your experiences with other likeminded people? Welcome to the first ever Nordic RSE in person 
conference! We believe you might really like it here. 

We are an association of professionals developing and using software for the needs of research. As such we aim to create 
a community of researchers, engineers, developers, digital experts and more, to talk about topics that are often overlooked 
in classical academic conferences. The focus of our conference is not on results of research, but rather on the tools that 
underlie those results. Additionally, we hope to foster a rich network of exchanges and conversations surrounding the 
practices of software development in research. 

Most research is already built on a foundation of sofware tools and the quality and reliability of those tools is key to
producing reliable results. And the importance of software keeps growing. In this conference we want to talk about what
pipelines you develop and use for your research, and how you use it, the software you develop, and how you got about
developing it.


## Where

On the [campus of Aalto University](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3TGvPnBw254T5X817) in Otaniemi, Espoo, Finland.


### How you can help

 - [Submit a contribution!](/events/2024-in-person-conference#call-for-contributions) In line with our previous online unconferences, our meetings are driven by our participants! What do you want to talk about? 
 - Encourage your colleagues to submit a contribution and/or join our association. Since the term RSE is still fairly new, they might not know about it yet and be hesitant to submit something. 
 - [Share the announcement with others](/events/2024-in-person-conference/). 
 - Do you want to volunteer and help us run our first in person conference? [Join us or get in touch with us](/about/governance/contact.md)!


## Call for Contributions

We invite you to submit contributions **by March 22nd**, on any topics related to research software. Whether you are using it or developing it yourself,
we are interested in your experience and expertise. Topics are divided roughly into 3 sessions, "Best Practices", "Technical" and
"Soft Skills". But don't let this limit you, many topics are welcome. Just submit your idea and we can discuss and find a spot for it!

All formats of communication are welcome (or check what we have done [in the unconference](/events/2023-online-unconference/)):
- *Discussion topics* (15-20 minutes): is software, research software community or research software engineering something close to your heart? Come chat with other enthusiasts!
- *Demonstrations:* show us some tools or software that you like
- *Workshops or [ReproHacks](https://reprohack.github.io/reprohack-hq/)* (max 3 hours in a day)
- *Talks* (20 minutes including 5 min questions): teach us something new
- *On-going projects*: share something unfinished or almost working that you would like to get feedback on
- *Something else*: is there something you would like to share that
  does not fit any of the previous points? We are looking forward to hearing
  about it!

The open (or 'unconference') session will include on day contributions, topics that arise during the conference.

And of course we will all follow a [Code of Conduct](https://nordic-rse.org/about/code-of-conduct/).

map](https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/nordic-rse-2024_1014563).

### Venue

Main venue: Aalto University, Konemiehentie 1, Espoo, Finland (building
called "Kide" but most people don't know that name).  All rooms are
right in the lobby area.

Thursday morning, before noon: "Top Lounge", Otakaari1, Espoo, Finland
(building name: Undergraduate Center).  You need a keycard to enter
this area, and access info will be updated closer to time.

Lunches are in the campus area, a short walk to other buildings.

All areas have step-free access.


### Registration

Registration includes both lunches, snacks, and coffee, and all
activities.  It doesn't include dinner, which has to be self-paid.
Depending on sponsorship, prices and/or included perks may be updated.

There is an evening sauna, but places are limited to ~25 people. The
first registrants get priority and spots will be allocated later.


### Arrival time

tldr: Arrive Wednesday evening, or very early Thursday for the
informal session.  Otherwise arriving before noon works.

If you arrive before or during Thursday morning, we have a informal
session before noon, which may include demonstrations, social
activities, hack time, getting to know each other, or more.  If you
arrive before noon, you can join us for lunch.  Talks begin at 13:00.

If you arrive Wednesday evening, some organizers will be around and
we'll try to arrange some activity together.


### Other activities

Our plan includes lunches, conference dinner, sauna.

[Wikivoyage Helsinki](https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Helsinki) is
usually pretty accurate and has information about the area and other
sights to see.


### Hotels

There are various hotels within easy walking distance.  We don't have
any particular discounts.  "Radison Blu Otaniemi" is the default
location for university visitors.  Other hotels in Helsinki downtown
are fine also, the metro trip is 11 minutes (and costs ~3 euros).


### Transportation

Aalto University is at the "Aalto University" metro stop.

**Air:** Helsinki Airport is the default choice.  Between the airport
and Aalto University, plan for max 1.5 hours (less than one hour is
possible if you are efficient).  From the airport, follow signs to the
train station.  Buy a ticket for zones ABC, this will get you all the
way to the university (see public transport).  Take the first train
that comes (either way gets to downtown in about the same time).  Walk
a bit to the main station and down to the metro station.  Take a metro
to the stop Aalto University (direction Tapiola or Kivenlahti), then
continue in section "public transport"

**Ferry:** From Tallinn or Stockholm, there are ferries. Expect well
under an hour to get from the ferry harbors to Aalto University.
(Some attendees are also attending the Nordic e-infrastructure
Conference in Tallinn on 27-29 May, they will be taking ferries from
Tallinn the evening of 29 May.  More info to be announced)

**Bus, Train, etc. within Finland:** You probably know how to get to
the center of Helsinki.  Follow public transit below.

**Private vehicle:** There isn't free parking, but there are paid lots
around.

**Public transport:** The public transport system is good and easy to
use.  The stop name is "Aalto University", and the A entrance may be
slightly easier to use.  Tickets can be bought at ticket machines, or
via the "HSL App".  Aalto University is in the zone B, downtown is in
the zone A, tickets last a bit more than an hour and work on any
public bus, train, metro, or tram (and as many transfers as you need).
AB zone tickets cost 2.95€.

If coming from airport: use single tickets, day tickets not worth it
even with one extra trip to/from downtown.
