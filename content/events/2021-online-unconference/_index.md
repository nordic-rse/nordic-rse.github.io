# Nordic RSE Unconference 2021

We are planning an online unconference on June 29–30. The program will consist of your contributions and we encourage you to submit a short abstract for a discussion topic, talk, demonstration or any other type of program you would like to run.

## Dates: June 29-30, 13-16 CET (3 + 3 hours)

## Format and goal and scope

To bring the community of research software engineers together in 2021,
to exchange ideas and solutions and challenges we plan an informal unconference.
In the unconference format we encourage participants to shape the program and
we will provide support and infrastructure for that.

This event is not only limited to the Nordics and not only limited to participants
who are or identify as RSEs, but anybody interested in the interface of research, software and data is welcome.


## What contributions we welcome

In principle we welcome any contributions which respect the [Code of Conduct](/events/2021-online-unconference/code_of_conduct)
and in principle of any length. We will try to arrange a program based on your input.

Here are some examples of possible contributions:
- Discussion topics (about software, the research software community, or anything related to RSEs)
- Demonstrations (tools you like, software you wrote)
- Quick workshops or reprohacks (only 3 hours in a day)
- Talks 
- Workshops and lessons: teach us something new
- Can also be something unfinished and almost working where you would like to get feedback on
