### Longer teaser

- Are you a research software engineer and want to share your successes and your failures?
- Need to network, share knowledge and experiences with your peers?

Nordic-RSE invites everyone interested in such topics to join our online
unconference (lightweight get-together) on October 25 and 26, where we let the
participants shape the agenda ("birds of a feather").
